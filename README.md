# Chrome Extension

My personal Chrome extensions.

# Why

- Installing an unknown Chrome extension is sometimes harmful as it might steal data.
- It is possible to inject any kind of code snnipets into any websites because it is unpacked extension.
- Creating a Chrome extension is easier and more fun to search extensions on the Chrome store and try it.

# Install

Step 1. Build it

```
yarn install
./build.sh
```

Step 2. Manually install this directory as unpacked extension from the browser menu.
